# This program will calculate the energy emitted by an electron in a hydrogen atom moving from n=2 to n=1, n=3 to n=1, n=4 to n=1, etc

# the Rydberg equation: energy = (-2.18*10^-18) (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)

# -2.18 * 10^-18 is a constant that will be defined by the variable r
r = (-2.18 * (10**-18))

# nf is the final electron orbital that the electron will be on (n=1)
final = 1

# n will represent ni, the inital orbital of the electron, which will vary as the orbitals get further away from n=2
n = 2

# make a loop to find the first 1000 energies
for loopCounter in range (0,1000):

    n = n+1

    # Rydberg Equation
    energy = r * ((1/(final**2))-(1/(n**2)))

    # multiply by -1 to give a positive energy value
    print(energy * -1)
